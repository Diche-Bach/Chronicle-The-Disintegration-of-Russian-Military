##Chronicle of the Disintegration of the Russian Military

###Introduction

This chronicle began in summer 2025 as a response to a Reddit discussion about whether there was any substantive proof of the degraded state of cohesion, morale, discipline, effectiveness, and solidarity within the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.

The answer is yes. There is now a vast and growing body of videos and reports showing that the Russian military suffers serious and recurring morale and discipline problems.

The entries collected here are not exhaustive. They represent an incomplete fraction of the open-source documentary evidence available online, primarily from Reddit reposts of Telegram footage and related social media sources. Some of the videos date back to 2022, but the bulk are from late 2024 and 2025.

Because this repository originated as an ad hoc response to that Reddit query, it currently lacks features that would enhance usability: consistent commentary beyond raw markup links, systematic tabulation of details like dates, locations, and units involved, and thematic grouping. It is therefore a work in progress.

Contributions are welcome. Readers are encouraged to duplicate or fork this repository, improve the organization, and expand the collection. The ultimate purpose of this Chronicle is to provide a public, educational, and research-friendly archive documenting the observable decline of Russian military cohesion, morale, and discipline throughout the Russo-Ukrainian War (2014–present).


###Early Documentation

None of this is theoretical. There are hundreds of videos documenting these practices, and dozens of credible investigative reports confirming them.

Collapse is never instantaneous. These things unravel gradually—until they suddenly fall apart completely. The Russian military, like the regime it serves, is locked in a feedback loop: growing brutality fuels deeper dysfunction, which in turn invites harsher repression. Eventually, that loop explodes—but not before massive human cost.

It happened in 1917, to the Russian Imperial army; it can happen again and it seems likely it will happen sometime between now and the end of 2027.

And yes, part of the reason it hasn’t happened yet is precisely what you suggest: some soldiers believe the regime’s lies, and many others are simply terrified to resist. It's not unique to Russia, but the scale and cruelty are unusually extreme.

The real mystery isn’t whether there’s a morale crisis in the Russian army. It’s how long the regime can keep stitching its collapsing force together with fear, brutality, and lies—before the whole thing finally gives way.

The largest country on Earth, blessed with vast natural resources, could easily sustain a broad middle class. Instead, under the rule of cruel, psychopathic, kleptocratic elites—and above all, the megalomaniac obsession with restoring the Soviet empire—Russia sends peasants like this man to die crawling alone through the fields of a peaceful neighbor it invaded.

He knew the truth instantly: a serious wound on the battlefield meant death. Whether he was the lone survivor of a failed assault, a scattered infiltrator, or simply abandoned, the result was the same. Medevac was impossible. Even had his comrades been nearby, the chance of rescue was close to zero. After a hard life as a modern-day serf, he made his last calculation the moment the Ukrainian FPV struck: check out quickly, or endure a slow agonizing death abandoned in foreign soil. He chose the gun.

What does it say about a regime that treats its own soldiers with such contempt—sending them on fringe, under-supported missions where serious injury equals either suicide or lingering agony?

This is the horror Western citizenry and leadership must fully grasp. Ukraine must not only survive, it must prevail. If Putin’s regime is not so thoroughly defeated that it provokes national upheaval—fragmentation or true reform—then even when this particular war ends, Russia will remain what it has become: a persistent threat to humanity.

3 Sept 2025 the lack of discipline and order in Putin's horde is used against them: [Ukrainian Soldier of 425th OSHP "Skelya" pretended to be one of the Russians, and then at the right moment he eliminated them](https://www.reddit.com/r/DroneCombat/comments/1n7b9r0/ukrainian_soldier_of_425th_oshp_skelya_pretended/)

Over the past 3.7 years, Putin's horde has transformed into a hobo army, with a few scraps of professionalism sprinkled in. There are scores of videos of troops clearly ‘on duty’ in civilian clothing, with zero emblems or identifiers. In fact, since Crimea and Donbas, running around in non-standard, indistinguishable garb has been the norm.

This lack of discipline, order, professionalism, and adherence to international standards of warfare is a double-edged sword. It allowed the Kremlin to pull off the ‘plausibly’ deniable Crimea takeover (which fooled no one except cowardly Western leaders). But it also makes even the simplest ruse highly credible to the average Russian trooper.

At this point, it would seem that just having your patch tucked under your armor and speaking Russian with a believable accent is enough to dupe them. A grey area? Maybe. But Putin created that grey area back in spring 2014, and he’s been cultivating it for more than a decade.

If the Kremlin wants a ‘level playing field,’ they’d need to multiply their discipline by an order of magnitude. Instead, they’re stuck with what they built: a shoddy-ass hobo army, easily tricked into extra casualties. That’s just a meager slice of justice.

The Russian text in the screenshot roughly translates to:

“Today, a Russian guy with the call sign ‘Swede’ carried the flag in the heart of the Russian city of Kupiansk, on the square where once stood a monument to the great Russian philosopher V. I. Ulyanov (Lenin). Eternal bonds and spiritual staples.”

Notes

Kupiansk: A city in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine, occupied by Russia in 2022 and later liberated by Ukraine. Russia continues to claim it symbolically.

Lenin reference: They call Lenin a “great Russian philosopher,” which is bizarrely propagandistic and intended as ideological nostalgia.

“Spiritual staples” (духовные скрепы): A common Putin-era propaganda phrase, meant to convey the supposed eternal cultural glue of the Russian people.

“Swede”: The soldier’s call sign, presented here as a patriotic symbol-bearer.

5 Sept 2025 [A wounded russian invader, missing a leg, finished himself off by detonating a grenade in the Donetsk region](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineInvasionVideos/comments/1n9hvfc/a_wounded_russian_invader_missing_a_leg_finished/)
A wounded Russian soldier self-detonates with a grenade after losing a leg in Donetsk region (August 2025).

Soldier was equipped with modern kit (Crye Precision AVS-style plate carrier with crotch flap, standard fatigues, gloves, knee/elbow pads, helmet, modern backpack). Despite grievous wounds, blood loss appeared minimal, he retained full dexterity and consciousness, and his injuries appeared plausibly survivable. Nonetheless, he calmly armed a grenade and killed himself within moments of being wounded.

His composure and gear suggest training and experience, yet his immediate reaction to a severe wound was self-destruction. This starkly illustrates a core rot in Putin’s army: soldiers so devoid of faith in rescue, leadership, or purpose that they prefer immediate death to enduring in hopes of surviving. A professional army fights to survive; a hobo army dies by its own hand.

It appears that the captions in Ukrainian start as part of a longer sentence where the captured Russian soldier is describing how a series of Ukrainian FPV kamikaze drones attacked in succession. I do not read or write Ukrainian, but my trusty robot does . . . Below are the results of my efforts to capture and translate each of the captions in full, line by line.

Whether because of idiomatic speech, context, incomplete closed-captions, or simply robot or human error, the language as initially translated appears fragmentary in the line-by-line translation.

As the robot explains: "Colloquial compression: Ukrainian and Russian soldiers often speak in clipped, shorthand phrasing under stress. That’s why the captions come across fragmented."

However, when I fed the entire sequence of translated lines back to the robot she returned the following coherent transcript:

> Then kamikaze [drones] — one, two, three, four, five — we just dropped down.
> They started firing incendiaries, explosions, everything… In short, nothing was left there.
> Another pair [of us]… one was wounded, the second went to help him, but later I saw the video. The guys said what happened: he just shot himself.
> 
> Yes, by then it was already clear that we were simply being sent as cannon fodder — meat, straight into open ground.
> Well, that’s it, there are no options.
> It’s not today or tomorrow — you just die.
