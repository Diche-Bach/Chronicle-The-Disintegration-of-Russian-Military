Based on the vast and growing number of videos and reports? The Russians are having serious morale and discipline problems in their armed forces. A few examples:

[Russian servicemen from the 2nd Motorized Rifle Company of the 163rd Tank Regiment of the Russian Armed Forces reportedly claimed to have bronchitis and refused to participate in a “meat assault.” Their commander threw them naked in a pit to cure them by firing above their heads and yelling.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineInvasionVideos/comments/1l767sh/russian_servicemen_from_the_2nd_motorized_rifle/)

[A soldier being dragged screaming behind a truck, allegedly for “abandoning his post.” His crime? Surviving when others died.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveForUkraine/comments/1kvcqn4/this_is_our_neighbor_in_the_eastno_humanity_among/)

[Videos of a commander and his subordinates beating and humiliating one of their comrades for "cowardice," i.e., not dying with everyone else in an assault.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/16n2dh3/russian_commander_is_shown_training_his/)

[Troops forced to fight each other bare-chested in a pit, as a form of punishment and humiliation—again, for failing to die in a suicidal assault](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/1kk86y6/russian_soldiers_who_refused_to_fight_were_put_in/)

[A reported 260+ confirmed suicides, and likely hundreds more unreported] (https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineInvasionVideos/comments/1kwnqrg/nsfwnsfl_aftermath_footage_of_a_botched_suicide/). [These are tracked by OSINT researchers using available video and forensic evidence]( https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineInvasionVideos/comments/1kwnqrg/nsfwnsfl_aftermath_footage_of_a_botched_suicide/mujdz9e/)

[Dozens of videos showing soldiers being beaten in detention, berated as cowards, traitors, and weaklings.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/1j18ul5/punishment_in_the_russian_army_presumably_for/)

[Confirmed incidents of fragging officers](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/1inohh9/russian_soldier_shoots_dead_four_comrades_while/), alongside evidence—both from POW testimony and intercepted communications—of the [use of barrier troops (“zagraditel’nye otryady”) in the Soviet tradition: informal death squads whose job is to shoot their own if they try to retreat.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/u7ywae/chechens_are_acting_as_barrier_troops_killing_rf/)

None of this is theoretical. There are hundreds of videos documenting these practices, and dozens of credible investigative reports confirming them.

Collapse is never instantaneous. These things unravel gradually—until they suddenly fall apart completely. The Russian military, like the regime it serves, is locked in a feedback loop: growing brutality fuels deeper dysfunction, which in turn invites harsher repression. Eventually, that loop explodes—but not before massive human cost.

It happened in 1917, to the Russian Imperial army; it can happen again and it seems likely it will happen sometime between now and the end of 2027.

And yes, part of the reason it hasn’t happened yet is precisely what you suggest: some soldiers believe the regime’s lies, and many others are simply terrified to resist. It's not unique to Russia, but the scale and cruelty are unusually extreme.

The real mystery isn’t whether there’s a morale crisis in the Russian army. It’s how long the regime can keep stitching its collapsing force together with fear, brutality, and lies—before the whole thing finally gives way.
