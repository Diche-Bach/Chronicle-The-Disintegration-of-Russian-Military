## Chronicle of the Disintegration of the Russian Military


### Introduction

This chronicle began in June 2025 as a response to a Reddit discussion about whether there was any substantive proof of the degraded state of cohesion, morale, discipline, effectiveness, and solidarity within the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.

The answer is yes. There is now a vast and growing body of videos and reports showing that the Russian military suffers serious and recurring morale and discipline problems.

The entries collected here are not exhaustive. They represent an incomplete fraction of the open-source documentary evidence available online, primarily from Reddit reposts of Telegram footage and related social media sources. Some of the videos date back to 2022, but the bulk are from late 2024 and 2025.

Because this repository originated as an ad hoc response to that Reddit query, it currently lacks features that would enhance usability: consistent commentary beyond raw markup links, systematic tabulation of details like dates, locations, and units involved, and thematic grouping. It is therefore a work in progress.

Contributions are welcome. Readers are encouraged to duplicate or fork this repository, improve the organization, and expand the collection. The ultimate purpose of this Chronicle is to provide a public, educational, and research-friendly archive documenting the observable decline of Russian military cohesion, morale, and discipline throughout the Russo-Ukrainian War (2014–present).

None of this is theoretical. There are hundreds of videos documenting these practices, and dozens of credible investigative reports confirming them.

Collapse is never instantaneous. These things unravel gradually—until they suddenly fall apart completely. The Russian military, like the regime it serves, is locked in a feedback loop: growing brutality fuels deeper dysfunction, which in turn invites harsher repression. Eventually, that loop explodes—but not before massive human cost.

It happened in 1917, to the Russian Imperial army; it can happen again and it seems likely it will happen sometime between now and the end of 2027.

And yes, part of the reason it hasn’t happened yet is precisely what you suggest: some soldiers believe the regime’s lies, and many others are simply terrified to resist. It's not unique to Russia, but the scale and cruelty are unusually extreme.

The real mystery isn’t whether there’s a morale crisis in the Russian army. It’s how long the regime can keep stitching its collapsing force together with fear, brutality, and lies—before the whole thing finally gives way.

Request: I welcome verification from a fluent Russian speaker who is demonstrably independent of the Putin regime. If I can be convincingly shown that this footage does not reflect dysfunction among Russian military personnel, I will remove it from the Chronicle.

The largest country on Earth, blessed with vast natural resources, could easily sustain a broad middle class. Instead, under the rule of cruel, psychopathic, kleptocratic elites—and above all, the megalomaniac obsession with restoring the Soviet empire—Russia sends peasants like this man to die crawling alone through the fields of a peaceful neighbor it invaded.

He knew the truth instantly: a serious wound on the battlefield meant death. Whether he was the lone survivor of a failed assault, a scattered infiltrator, or simply abandoned, the result was the same. Medevac was impossible. Even had his comrades been nearby, the chance of rescue was close to zero. After a hard life as a modern-day serf, he made his last calculation the moment the Ukrainian FPV struck: check out quickly, or endure a slow agonizing death abandoned in foreign soil. He chose the gun.

What does it say about a regime that treats its own soldiers with such contempt—sending them on fringe, under-supported missions where serious injury equals either suicide or lingering agony?

This is the horror Western citizenry and leadership must fully grasp. Ukraine must not only survive, it must prevail. If Putin’s regime is not so thoroughly defeated that it provokes national upheaval—fragmentation or true reform—then even when this particular war ends, Russia will remain what it has become: a persistent threat to humanity.

3 Sept 2025 the lack of discipline and order in Putin's horde is used against them: [Ukrainian Soldier of 425th OSHP "Skelya" pretended to be one of the Russians, and then at the right moment he eliminated them](https://www.reddit.com/r/DroneCombat/comments/1n7b9r0/ukrainian_soldier_of_425th_oshp_skelya_pretended/)

Over the past 3.7 years, Putin's horde has transformed into a hobo army, with a few scraps of professionalism sprinkled in. There are scores of videos of troops clearly ‘on duty’ in civilian clothing, with zero emblems or identifiers. In fact, since Crimea and Donbas, running around in non-standard, indistinguishable garb has been the norm.

This lack of discipline, order, professionalism, and adherence to international standards of warfare is a double-edged sword. It allowed the Kremlin to pull off the ‘plausibly’ deniable Crimea takeover (which fooled no one except cowardly Western leaders). But it also makes even the simplest ruse highly credible to the average Russian trooper.

At this point, it would seem that just having your patch tucked under your armor and speaking Russian with a believable accent is enough to dupe them. A grey area? Maybe. But Putin created that grey area back in spring 2014, and he’s been cultivating it for more than a decade.

If the Kremlin wants a ‘level playing field,’ they’d need to multiply their discipline by an order of magnitude. Instead, they’re stuck with what they built: a shoddy-ass hobo army, easily tricked into extra casualties. That’s just a meager slice of justice.

The Russian text in the screenshot roughly translates to:

“Today, a Russian guy with the call sign ‘Swede’ carried the flag in the heart of the Russian city of Kupiansk, on the square where once stood a monument to the great Russian philosopher V. I. Ulyanov (Lenin). Eternal bonds and spiritual staples.”

Notes

Kupiansk: A city in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine, occupied by Russia in 2022 and later liberated by Ukraine. Russia continues to claim it symbolically.

Lenin reference: They call Lenin a “great Russian philosopher,” which is bizarrely propagandistic and intended as ideological nostalgia.

“Spiritual staples” (духовные скрепы): A common Putin-era propaganda phrase, meant to convey the supposed eternal cultural glue of the Russian people.

“Swede”: The soldier’s call sign, presented here as a patriotic symbol-bearer.

5 Sept 2025 [A wounded russian invader, missing a leg, finished himself off by detonating a grenade in the Donetsk region](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineInvasionVideos/comments/1n9hvfc/a_wounded_russian_invader_missing_a_leg_finished/)
A wounded Russian soldier self-detonates with a grenade after losing a leg in Donetsk region (August 2025).

Soldier was equipped with modern kit (Crye Precision AVS-style plate carrier with crotch flap, standard fatigues, gloves, knee/elbow pads, helmet, modern backpack). Despite grievous wounds, blood loss appeared minimal, he retained full dexterity and consciousness, and his injuries appeared plausibly survivable. Nonetheless, he calmly armed a grenade and killed himself within moments of being wounded.

His composure and gear suggest training and experience, yet his immediate reaction to a severe wound was self-destruction. This starkly illustrates a core rot in Putin’s army: soldiers so devoid of faith in rescue, leadership, or purpose that they prefer immediate death to enduring in hopes of surviving. A professional army fights to survive; a hobo army dies by its own hand.

It appears that the captions in Ukrainian start as part of a longer sentence where the captured Russian soldier is describing how a series of Ukrainian FPV kamikaze drones attacked in succession. I do not read or write Ukrainian, but my trusty robot does . . . Below are the results of my efforts to capture and translate each of the captions in full, line by line.

Whether because of idiomatic speech, context, incomplete closed-captions, or simply robot or human error, the language as initially translated appears fragmentary in the line-by-line translation.

As the robot explains: "Colloquial compression: Ukrainian and Russian soldiers often speak in clipped, shorthand phrasing under stress. That’s why the captions come across fragmented."

However, when I fed the entire sequence of translated lines back to the robot she returned the following coherent transcript:

> Then kamikaze [drones] — one, two, three, four, five — we just dropped down.
> They started firing incendiaries, explosions, everything… In short, nothing was left there.
> Another pair [of us]… one was wounded, the second went to help him, but later I saw the video. The guys said what happened: he just shot himself.
> 
> Yes, by then it was already clear that we were simply being sent as cannon fodder — meat, straight into open ground.
> Well, that’s it, there are no options.
> It’s not today or tomorrow — you just die.

He might’ve just gotten terribly wounded and didn’t want to feel the pain anymore. Also, a lot of these guys know that another drone drop munition or FPV drone could be on the way and most likely is on the way. They don’t want to go through the agony of suffering. I Think that they know they are wounded.. there is no hope for rescue or escape from the front line. So I think a lot of these guys just end it on their own terms while they still have a weapon or grenade close by to utilize and they still have functioning arms and hands that aren’t blown off or mangled yet. so I think that sums up a lot of their thinking.

-=-=-=-=-

That seems like a solid summation of the main factors. One could add: weeks or months in atrocious living conditions—cold, mud, vermin, hunger, exhaustion—layered with constant physical and psycho-social abuse from their own commanders. Day after day they witness comrades left to suffer without aid, sometimes in full view. When you combine that with the accumulated trauma of watching dozens or even hundreds of men be maimed or killed, plus the despair of knowing no help is coming, it corrodes whatever resilience remains.

For someone without much intellectual or emotional resilience to begin with, it can become a perfect recipe for collapse: the war reduces every choice to misery, and suicide becomes the only form of control left to them.

Romance (summer: triumph, adventure, heroism)

Tragedy (autumn: decline, catastrophe)

Irony/Satire (winter: disintegration, absurdity, horror)

The Story of Putin's Horde is deep into the final stage: irony/horror — a spiral of disintegration, absurdity, and futility. So absurd and horrific it has cycled back around to comedy akin to Monty Python, Whitest Kids U Know, or a Hard Bass School’s meme

This doesn’t look like a dugout or reinforced bunker; look like an improvised billet inside a commandeered house, in sum a highly insecure location for bivouac.

As others have noted, the soldier’s reaction to the blast (a muted exhalation, no panic, no alarm) shows both psychological exhaustion and an almost fatalistic acceptance of his exposure. My Slavic language mastery is quite limited; but pretty sure the phrase he utters toward the end is "пиздец» (pizdets)," which translates roughly as: “Completely fucked.”

Drunkenness, though not confirmable, is a plausible factor. The incident could have been an “accident” (in which case drunken negligence itself constitutes malfeasance), but it may also have been an attempted suicide or self-inflicted wound to evade combat duty.

Altogether, the case belongs in the Chronicle

In the video, a Russian soldier is recording a message to his wife, describing high casualties, constant drone attacks, dangers from land mines, and the mistreatment of the dead.

It is always fascinating to see one of these and consider the ethnographic inferences we can make.

The first thing I would note: this individual’s manner and attire suggest he is experienced and belongs to the tier of Russia’s better-trained and more valued troops, the so-called Контрактники (Kontraktniki, “contract soldiers”) vs. Мясо (Myaso, “meat”). This is also reflected in his claim that they had walked 14 or 15 kilometers in the preceding 24 hours, which suggests his unit had been redeployed as a reinforcement.

Several inferences can be drawn from his message structure, his phrasing, and his visible attentiveness to who might overhear him. He records while walking amid a Russian position, probably to appear nonchalant. The information included in the final part of his message would almost certainly be deemed illegal. Walking casually while filming himself with his phone makes it look like an ordinary video for his wife. That reduces the chance a Стукач (Stukach, “informer,” literally “knocker”) might report him for subversive speech.

He leaves the restricted content for the very end, and when it comes, he keeps it short: the bodies are being tossed into unmarked pits and then recorded as “missing.” His expression and tone suggest he knows this will shock his wife. The earlier talk about seas of bodies, exhaustion, and devastation was camouflage, filler that could be overheard without consequence. The real message is brief and dangerous: someone in command is lying, and families are being robbed of their death payments. From this we can infer he is not an officer, though perhaps an NCO.

The fact that bodies are dumped into common graves in Ukraine does not in itself prove that they will be registered as “missing.” But this soldier claims that is what is happening, which means he has seen enough, or heard enough from others, to believe it. If he is saying it on camera, soldiers are talking about it among themselves. And if they are talking about it, then mutiny is in the air.

It is one thing to exploit the low-status castes of Russian society (convicts, migrants, addicts, ethnic minorities, etc.), training and arming them poorly, then expending them as disposable assets. These Мясо (Myaso, “meat”) are unlikely to have many advocates at home, and their testimony can be dismissed as the word of untrustworthy отбросы (otbrosy, “dregs” / “human refuse”). But this man does not appear to be from that world. He looks and speaks like someone from the loyalist core of “ethnic Russians” who may have even voted for Putin. And here lies the danger for the regime: its repressive apparatus is made up of men like this. The more they are defrauded and mistreated, the more fragile the system becomes.

Most likely he and his wife were loyal until very recently. He probably signed up, or extended his contract, for the money. And the two of them had accepted that if he died, at least she would receive the compensation. The whole purpose of this message is to warn her: “If I go missing, I might have been stuffed in a bag and buried in an unmarked grave somewhere in Ukraine.”

Пиздец (Pizdets, “utter disaster/fucked beyond repair”) indeed . . .

["We’re cannon fodder, being sent straight to slaughter. Every tree line, open area, everywhere is strewn with Russian corpses."

[A serviceman of the Russian Armed Forces shows the situation on the southern front. Brief and clearOther Video (v.redd.it)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/1o15pye/a_serviceman_of_the_russian_armed_forces_shows/)

The video "A serviceman of the Russian Armed Forces shows the situation on the southern front. Brief and clear" is 8 seconds long.

The individual is sitting in the forest filming (his foot is visible initially). He films a decomposing corpse 3 or 4 meters in front of him. He then turns his camera to show there is a second corpse immediately behind him.

Presumably, he finds himself "stuck" in the position he is in to some extent, whether because he was ordered to take up that exact position or he is unable to move away from the corpses for some other reason.

After filming the two corpses in his midst, he then points the camera at himself and flashes he “shaka” or “hang loose” gesture (thumb and pinky extended, other fingers folded) a hand sign of relaxed acknowledgment or informal camaraderie.

In Russian or Eastern European military and slang contexts (especially among younger troops), this gesture has a few potential overlapping meanings:

Casual bravado: As in Western pop culture, the shaka can mean “it’s all good,” “I’m chill,” or “still alive.” Among Russian soldiers, it’s sometimes used ironically: a kind of “yeah, we’re in hell, but whatever.”

Dark humor/gallows irony: Given the setting (two corpses nearby, him alive), this is almost certainly ironic: a soldier acknowledging the absurdity and horror of the situation, using a globalized gesture of carefree normalcy. It’s “nothing to see here, just another day in paradise.”

While I would not say that this video is a clear sign of either high or low morale/cohesion/effectiveness, the simple fact that the solder found it expedient in his situation to record this video with the ironic/sardonic ending is worthy of curation . . .

Two Russian troops, by themselves, with zero hope of medevac; they appear to have been attacked by Ukrainian long-range fires, perhaps a drone, mortar or artillery strike. One appears to have been killed instantly. The other suffered wounds to both legs as evidenced by the tourniquets. The latter subsequently realized that he was doomed and ended his own life with rifle fire to his face.

This is the deplorable state of Putin's horde: men are sent forward in efforts to take control of land despite the fact that the force is so spread thin that serious wounds which might otherwise be survivable are effectively lethal. Scenes like this one exemplify why Russian casualties are only only high compared to their rate of strategic advance, but also unbelievably lethal. 

Recent article on ISW concluded that Russian casualties in recent periods are in the 1 (killed) : 1.3 (wounded) which is . . . medieval.

[Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, 7 October 2025](https://understandingwar.org/research/russia-ukraine/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-october-7-2025/)

> Ukraine’s “I Want to Live” initiative reported that Russia’s casualty ratio is one KIA for every 1.3 WIA, likely due to insufficient tactical medicine training and the Russian military command’s frequent failure to sufficiently rehabilitate WIA. The standard KIA to WIA ratio is one-to-three, which demonstrates that the Russian forces currently appear to have an abnormally high KIA to WIA ratio (1:1.3) likely due to the efficacy of pervasive tactical-level drone strikes that have created kill zones (an area immediately near the frontline where a mass of tactical strike and reconnaissance drones pose an elevated risk to any equipment or personnel that enters the area) throughout the theater, complicating both sides ability to evacuate casualties and triage WIA.
