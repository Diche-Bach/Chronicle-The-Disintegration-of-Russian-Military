# Chronicle-The-Disintegration-of-Russian-Military

Overview

Chronicle: The Disintegration of Russian Military is a public research archive and educational repository intended to document the observable decline of the Russian Armed Forces in the context of the Russo-Ukrainian War (2014–Present).

This project curates and preserves publicly available evidence—including but not limited to:

    Firsthand video documentation

    Testimonies and reports from Russian and Ukrainian sources

    Open-source intelligence (OSINT)

    Eyewitness statements

    Insider leaks, defection interviews, and intercepted communications

    Reddit commentaries and social media threads with verified or plausible sourcing

The archive aims to support independent researchers, journalists, analysts, historians, and the general public in understanding the systemic failures, morale crises, and structural decay of Russian military forces during the conflict.

Mission

This repository exists to:

    Provide a centralized and organized archive of credible data points indicating dysfunction within the Russian military

    Counter disinformation by preserving a record of verifiable evidence before it is deleted, manipulated, or obscured

    Encourage transparent, data-driven discussions about military behavior, state capacity, and the human toll of authoritarian warfare
    

Structure

At launch, this repository consists primarily of a direct, lightly annotated copy of a ~10,000-character Reddit post aggregating links to publicly available evidence of declining morale and cohesion within the Russian Armed Forces. This includes mutinies, surrenders, desertions, refusals to fight, intra-unit violence, and related phenomena.

Each item is linked to its original source—usually a Reddit thread, video post, or article—with minimal markup for readability.

Planned future improvements include thematic and chronological restructuring, with eventual tagging and categorization by:

    Unit type (e.g., VDV, Wagner, Rosgvardia)

    Event type (e.g., mutiny, surrender, desertion, fratricide, refusal to fight)

    Geographic region (e.g., Donbas, Bakhmut, Belgorod, Crimea)

    Media format (e.g., video, transcript, tweet, article, forum post)

These enhancements are aspirational and will be implemented incrementally as the project develops.
